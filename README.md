# ethics-bowl-scoring

This will be an R script for computing scores for Ethics Bowl, specifically for the 7th Annual Long Island High School Ethics Bowl. See the [Squire Family Foundation page](http://squirefoundation.org/ethics-bowls/ "Ethics Bowls | Squire Family Foundation").

**VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.**

In line with Hadley Wickham's [definition of “tidy Data”](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf), and Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*,

* each row represents an event — here, a performance by a particular team in a round;
* each row represents a variable — here, an attribute of a team's performance in a round.
